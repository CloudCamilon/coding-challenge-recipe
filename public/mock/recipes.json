    "description": "Sinigang na Salmon sa Miso is my favorite version of fish sinigang. It has that comforting sour taste of sinigang which was made better by the savory taste of miso. That is just the tip of the iceberg though, metaphorically speaking. The salmon heads are the main stars of the dish. It is delicious and very tasty. It also contains fish oil thatis said to be good for the heart.",
